# Logical Database Design Antipatterns

## Jaywalking

Definition: In a `Many-To-Many` situation, where one record in table 1 relates to many records in table 2, and also vice versa.    
For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(1000),
account_id VARCHAR(100), -- comma-separated list -- . . .
);
INSERT INTO Products (product_id, product_name, account_id) VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Visual TurboBuilder', '12,34');
```
One product might have multiple account (`account_id`) related to it, storing them as a array of string/ints might come to mind first when programming because it is fairly intuitive, however, some underlying problems come later when querying, updating, inserting, etc. since you have to parse the string array into a list of account_ids by either using string split functions or Regx, which damage the sql performance and also the functions extension possibilities in the future.

âœ…
Creating a new `Intersection` table solves the problem neatly.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Contacts (
        product_id  BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        account_id  BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (product_id, account_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
);
      INSERT INTO Contacts (product_id, accont_id)
      VALUES (123, 12), (123, 34), (345, 23), (567, 12), (567, 34);
```

## Native Trees

Hierarchical data or treelike data, for example relationship of employees to managers.   

Alternative solutions:

### Path Enumeration

Drawbacks: data type VARCHAR has the length limit anyway, not ideal when tree depth is unknown(might unlimited). 

### Nested Sets
Complicated and not neat, ignore for now.

### Closure Table

![pic2](/img/in-post/sql_antipatterns/closure_table_2.jpg)

THis way, the relationship is maintained in a separate table like what we did before for jaywalking. Even if the relations are deleted, the data it self still exists, for example in above case, the `comments` table.  

## ID Required

* when Artificial value that has no meaning in the domain modelled by the table is used as primary key, it is called `pseudokey`.

* Specify other domain related attribute as primary key or composite attributes as compound key when making more sense.

* Pseudokey is not mandatory, it is a convention for a lot of developers, but you don't have to follow it when it doesn't help.

## Keyless Entry

Using foreign keys instead of application code implementation to keep the `Referential Integrity`, avoiding the __Catch-22__ scenario.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Bugs (
-- . . .
reported_by BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NEW', FOREIGN KEY (reported_by) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE RESTRICT, /*You cannot delete the account if it is used in Bugs table.*/
  FOREIGN KEY (status) REFERENCES BugStatus(status)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    ON DELETE SET DEFAULT /*Whenever a status value, any bugs with that status automatically reset to default.*/
);
```

## Entity Attribute Value (EAV)

Each entity in the table is a `attribute-value` pair, for example:

```sql
INSERT INTO IssueAttributes (issue_id, attr_name, attr_value)
  VALUES
    (1234, 'product', '1' ),
    (1234, 'date_reported', '2009-06-01' ),
    (1234, 'status', 'NEW' ),
    (1234, 'description', 'Saving does not work' ),
    (1234, 'reported_by', 'Bill' ),
    (1234, 'version_affected', '1.0'),
    (1234, 'severity', 'loss of functionality' ),
    (1234, 'priority', 'high');
```

In this way, number of columns doesn't grow even with new attributes introduced in, and NULL value columns that entities with inapplicable attributes can be avoided. It shares something with NoSQL, like the key-value pair.

Cons: 
* sacrifices the data integrity that relational databases brings. Also makes query more complicated.
* mandatory attributes not possible.
* SQL data types unusable.

A solution regarding to this EAV design is `Single Table Inheritance`, `Concrete Table Inheritance`, `Class Table Inheritance`, `Semi-structured Data`

* Single Table Inheritance   

A single table store all subtypes' columns together. Set attribute to NULL when it is not applicable for another subtype.  But you might encounter number of columns limit, and also no metadata per subtype, which makes difficult for other people to understand the table structures, might also for designer himself as well after a while.

For example:   

```sql
CREATE TABLE Issues (
  issue_id         SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  reported_by      BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  product_id       BIGINT UNSIGNED,
  priority         VARCHAR(20),
  version_resolved VARCHAR(20),
  status           VARCHAR(20),
  issue_type       VARCHAR(10),  -- BUG or FEATURE
  severity         VARCHAR(20),  -- only for bugs
  version_affected VARCHAR(20),  -- only for bugs
  sponsor          VARCHAR(50),  -- only for feature requests
  FOREIGN KEY (reported_by) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```

* Concrete Table Inheritance 
Separate table for each subtype. This is not new.


* Class Table Inheritance

A base table defines all common columns, and each subtype table contains type specific columns. Tables connected by a foreign key.   


* Semi-structured Data

A table store all common attributes, and a `BLOB` column store data in format such as XML or JSON which encodes both attribute names and values.   
This design is helpful when you have to support new columns frequently. But fetching a specific attribute can be a pain.

## Polymorphic Associations


# Query Antipatterns

## Fear of Unknown(NULL)

> :white_square_button:   TODO: notes started on page 171 for this chapter, might need to add previous parts later. 

* Recommended to put a `non-null` constraint, and maybe set default values in case the column is omitted when inserting, but for sure, should be a logic value.

* Dynamic default: `COALESCE()` is a good function for this, since it returns the first non-null variable from a list of passed in variables.

## Implicit Columns

Specify columns explicitly for example in SELECT and INSERT queries to avoid issues as follows:

* Query is independent on column positions in the table, for example in INSERT query.
* New added columns won't affect our existing queries.
* If column got dropped, the query raises an error explicitly display which codes need to be fixed.


# Application Development Antipatterns


## Readable Passwords
* Using HASH function to encode plain passwords
* Add `Salt` (a meaningless string) to user passwords then hash, which makes almost impossible for attackers to do trial and error attack because they lack knowledge about this specific `salt` and how it is concatenated to the real password string. The user-specific salt would adds more security to the system.

## SQL Injection

Using query parameters is a way to prevent SQL Injection, but it is not a universal solution unfortunately.
Because parameter is always interpreted as a single literal value:

* List of values cannot be a single parameter
* Table identifier cannot be a parameter
* Column identifier cannot be a parameter
* SQL keyword cannot be a parameter:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Bugs ORDER BY date_reported 'DESC'
```

### Solutions

* Filter the input and only pass valid values to SQL statement
* Parameterize Dynamic Values, fails the following injection attempt.
```sql
UPDATE Accounts SET password_hash = SHA2('xyzzy')
WHERE account_id = '123 OR TRUE'
```
* Quoting Dynamic Values

Parameterize dynamic values is the best solution for preventing SQL injection in most cases, however, this might leads to inefficient query since the database is liable to choose the wrong optimization plan, for example when a column values are not evenly distributed, say 90% of values are 1 and the other 10% are 0, using the index to query value 0 would be much more efficient whereas it is not the case for querying value 1 because a full table scan in this situation is faster. 

An example of using quoting dynamic values:

```php
<?php
$quoted_active = $pdo->quote($_REQUEST["active"]);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE is_active = {$quoted_active}";
$stmt = $pdo->query($sql);
```

* Isolate User Input from Code

Build a mapping from user_input to sql_parameter_value will avoid unwanted inputs, also making default parameter values possible when user_input is not valid or desired.

This also make any part of an SQL statement dynamic, including identifiers, SQL keywords, and even the entire expressions.

From system design perspective, the internal details of the database are now decoupled from the user interface.


Some golden guidelines for the SQL Injection inspection:

1. Find SQL statements that are formed using application variables, string concatenation, or replacement.
2. Trace the origin of all dynamic content used in the SQL statements.
3. Assume any external contents is potentially hazardous. Trying to use filters, mappings, etc. to transform the untrusted content.
4. Combing external data to SQL statements using query parameters as explained above.
